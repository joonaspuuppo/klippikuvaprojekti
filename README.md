# Klippikuvaprojekti

A birthday present to a friend who has documented his life for 10 years through short daily video clips. I extracted (roughly) one frame from each clip and put those frames together to form a short video. I used ffmpeg-python and ffprobe-python (FFMPEG wrappers for Python) to handle the video and image files.
